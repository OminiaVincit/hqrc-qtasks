## Code structures
(To be updated)

## Requirements
The code requires the following libraries:
- python 3.6-3.7
- numpy, matplotlib, sklearn

The packages can be installed as follows. First, we recommend to create a virtual environment in Python3 and use pyenv to manage python version:

```create virtual env
# Create virtual environment
pyenv install 3.7.7
python3 -m venv ~/vqrc 
source ~/vqrc/bin/activate
pyenv local 3.7.7
```

Install the following packages for the basic functions of our implementations:
- Calculate the quantum memory capacities of quantum reservoir (HQR)
- Perform Tomography Tasks

```
# For running scripts in the nonlinear folder
pip3 install numpy matplotlib sklearn 
```
